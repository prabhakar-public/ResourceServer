# File for mapping si-internal-roles with roles coming from auth provider external-roles aka
# This file is expected to be different for each client and possibly vary across a client's environment
# This file is going to be common across all si modules for a client. So it will be in the client-<state> top level directory.
# Since there is potential for multiple ADs or auth providers (internal vs. external users), the values are a list,
#  and we expect the list to have one entry per auth provider. It may be prudent to keep the external names different
#  across the different auth providers

# key is the GWT SI internal role. values are list of different external auth server provided roles
#  list is needed in case we support multiple ID providers, and they have different role configurations
